//TODO: 1) find out why we have to copy the array "a" here instead of just returning it. My guess is that if we return array "a",
//we are simply returning a pointer to it. But even if we return array "result", are we not simply returning a pointer to array "result"
//as well? If in both instance, we are returning a pointer, then what is the difference anyway? Require some serious thinking
